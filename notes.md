1. state managenmenet, routing, redux toolkit, 


steps:
1. First create environment variables - If we are using any database in that only app should function because anytype password ids are used in here it will create problem because react is front end library so whatever the variables we are using it will be stored in database of backend where secret manager will maintain all these things. In this environment valriables will be stored separately. create environment variable (.env) in this dot is very important. It will be created separately. not in source project.
a. Create environment sapmle varibale to store all environment variables to prevent to push it into the github.
b. How to get access to environment variable file - If we console the data of environment variable it shows error that process is not drfined because we are using vite app so REACT_APP-APPWRITE-URL using react is not correct so use vite and use import in process of app.jsx. Go through documentation of vite app.
c. so in place of React app need to write vite only and in process place use import meta

2. Create project id, databade id, collicrtion id, bucket id in appwrite app by creating new project.

3. To prevent failure of  import of data from app of url and projrct ids create a folder and file conf js file and inject all these keys and ids and export the file.

4. Services - It is a type of class in this if you remove authentication from any dtabase services like appwrite the application will not be disturbed for function. So it will prevent any type of disturbances.

5. This auth.js file is very important if you change any database like appwrite firebase or own database whatever if it changes in authentication it will not disturb the app runs smoothly. So this is same for all apps and save this snippet for future use very helpful and important.
for this create class and import client, account, and id from appwrite. Export class AuthService class. to use this class create new object like authserivice as new AuthService. 
create a client and new client. Create constructor and this.client and set setendpoint and setProject and project id and url. use async unless previous executed for that createAccount. to prevent failure use in try and catch method.in try create account with email, password and name and unique id. 
Create login account in this use createEmailSession. If login is successful or not how to find for that one more function called getCurrentuser. One more function logout in this current session will be deleted. 
6. this is authentication service class and there is need to databse classes service. 
  In config file in updatePost // Slug means id it is put seperate because which particlaur post to be updated.
  in deletePost  after try catch use return true that post is deleted and after console error return false that if it is error return false. 
  If you want a particular document use getDocument.If you want all documents use getPosts but in this all documents will come in which status is not active for that use query. use query syntax . to apply query you shoukd enter indexes in appwrite. 

7. Storage- create folder file of store how to store data. It may be storred anywhere.
 in store import configurestore. create store in configurestore. in this one object and a reducer whic is empty object. then export store .
 8. Create authslice file import createSlice from reduxtoolkit and creae initialstate in theis statu and userdata, 
 and create authslice from createslice in thi s name intilastata and reducers which is object in thsi login in this state and action access in this callback take state form status which is true and userstate from state and action payload userDaa. In logout use state in this staus from state and usrData from state userData as null.
9. create components in this create HEader and Footer files created. Create index file import both here to use in future and export.
10. In app.jsx 
Import necessary modules and components.
React is imported for creating React components.
useState and useEffect are hooks for managing state and side effects in functional components.
useDispatch is used to get the dispatch function from the Redux store.
./App.css is an assumed style file for styling the components.
authService is imported from "./appwrite/auth" for handling authentication logic.
login and logout are actions from "./store/authSlice" used to update the authentication state.
Footer and Header are assumed components for the footer and header of the application.
Outlet is imported from 'react-router-dom' for handling nested routes.
Define a functional component named App.
Initialize state variable loading using the useState hook. It is used to track whether data is still loading.
Get the dispatch function from the Redux store using the useDispatch hook.
Use the useEffect hook to perform side effects in the component.
Call the getCurrentUser method from authService to get the current user data.
If user data exists, dispatch the login action with the user data; otherwise, dispatch the logout action.
Set loading to false in the finally block to indicate that data loading is complete.
 create loading state beacause network request takes time for that loading is true ot not for taht cretae useState using loading and setLoadign and put true. dispatch using useDispatch. 
After it is loaded ask using useEffect is it logged in or not. useEffect callbakfuintion ask authservice about currenctuser. use .then and .finally 
in then data will be avalilable check whether 

11. Create container in component in this property as children it is like box in this classes like width how much we neeed by css and in this children is added in div. and export this container
12. In footer add css how do you want in this Link is vry important and it is imported from reactrouterdom and Logo also it is important. and create separate file for this.
13. In Header folder create Logout file in this need to dispatch and use reduce for that   import useDist]patch form redux and authservice form appwrite config and logout feom stor. create dispatch using useDispatch hook and create handler  in this callbak authservice give logout froom config.js in this promis will be avalilbale for that use then and dispatch logout  In return button is created as logout. a
